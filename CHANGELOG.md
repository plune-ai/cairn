# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Inline metric legend.** `report.md`'s Metrics table now carries a `meaning` column and a ↑/↓
  direction per metric (plus a one-line key explaining the glyphs and the `judge` tag); the console
  `=== Metrics ===` output appends the same ↑/↓ glyph so `case_redundancy` / `flaky_ratio` (lower is
  better) can't be misread. A new README **Metrics** section documents every metric. All three render
  from one source of truth — `METRIC_LEGEND` in `src/eval/legend.ts` — so they can't drift. No metric
  value or name changed.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-19

### Changed

- **Drop `@langchain/langgraph` — plain async pipeline (ADR-0013).** The LangGraph
  `StateGraph` / `Annotation.Root` orchestrator is replaced by `runExploreGraph(deps, init):
  Promise<ExploreOutcome>` — a plain async function with sequential `await` calls for each
  stage. The stage seams (`BrowserGateway`, `StructuredInvoke`) and all domain node bodies are
  untouched. The generate⇄validate⇄repair portion now delegates to the existing `runRepairLoop`
  helper (removing the inline keep-best duplicate). `@langchain/core` (provider-agnostic LLM
  factory) is retained; only the graph orchestration layer is removed.
- **Telemetry rebound at the LLM layer.** Each run is wrapped in a lazy Langfuse root span
  (`startActiveObservation` from `@langfuse/tracing`); `RoleRouter` threads the
  `@langfuse/langchain` `CallbackHandler` into every LLM call config — preserving the full
  nested trace structure (one root span, one nested generation per stage LLM call) without
  LangGraph as the propagation vehicle. `last_trace_id` is returned in `ExploreOutcome`.
- **Ink / React are now optional.** The TUI packages (`ink`, `react`, `ink-select-input`,
  `ink-text-input`, `ink-spinner`) moved from `dependencies` to `optionalDependencies`. A
  default `npm install @plune-ai/cairn` no longer pulls them — install them manually to enable
  the interactive TUI (`npm i ink react ink-select-input ink-spinner ink-text-input`). If the
  packages are absent, `cairn` with no arguments falls back gracefully to printing help.

### Removed

- **`@langchain/langgraph`** from `dependencies` and the codebase (no import anywhere — grep clean).
- **`scripts/spike-s5-langfuse.ts`** and its npm script (`spike:s5-langfuse`) — the S5 spike is
  closed and its langgraph import is no longer valid.

> **Backward compatibility:** the public API (`runExploration`, `runDesign`, `runAutomate`,
> `loadConfig`), all `explore` / `design` / `automate` / `observe` CLI commands, existing
> configs, sessions, and run artifacts are unchanged. Telemetry and the TUI are opt-in — install
> their optional packages to use them. Tests: 416 green (vitest), coverage gate passes.

[0.4.0]: https://github.com/plune-ai/cairn/compare/v0.3.4...v0.4.0

## [0.3.4] - 2026-06-18

### Fixed

- **Interactive TUI: promote more than one manual case per review session.** In the run-detail review
  (`cairn` TUI → open a run → Cases tab), pressing `a` to promote a manual case (MTC → ATC) worked only
  ONCE per mount — every later `a` was swallowed until you exited the review and re-entered. Two causes:
  a one-shot `promoted` flag set on the first promote and never reset, and the `useInput` handler closing
  over a stale case snapshot between rapid keypresses. The handler now reads the current case + selection
  through refs (never a mount snapshot), the in-flight guard resets on completion, the case list reloads
  and re-sorts after each promote, and the selection is clamped to stay in range. You can now promote
  MTC #1, navigate to MTC #2, press `a`, and it promotes too — no exit/re-enter. Promoting an
  already-ATC case is a safe no-op.

[0.3.4]: https://github.com/plune-ai/cairn/compare/v0.3.3...v0.3.4

## [0.3.3] - 2026-06-18

### Fixed

- **Works inside projects that already have Playwright.** Cairn no longer pulls a second, *alpha*
  `playwright-core`: the experimental `cli` backend's `@playwright/cli` is now an optional peer, so a
  default install resolves a **single stable `playwright-core`** — the same build Cairn launches at
  runtime and the same one its installer targets. Previously the alpha needed a Chromium revision a
  normal `playwright install` never provided, so Cairn reported *"Playwright browsers are not
  installed"* even after following the suggested command.
- **The browser preflight no longer blocks the channel / reuse paths.** `explore` and
  `automate --validate` now pass the configured browser channel to the preflight, so `--channel chrome`
  / `BROWSER_CHANNEL=chrome` drives your installed Google Chrome with **zero download**, and an
  already-installed compatible Chromium is reused instead of demanding a re-install. The generated
  `@playwright/test` config carries the channel end-to-end.
- **Accurate browser diagnostics.** The "browsers not installed" message now prints Cairn's own
  Playwright version, the exact Chromium it expects, and the two real fixes — never the generic
  `npx playwright install` hint, which resolved to the *wrong* Playwright and so never helped.

### Added

- `cairn install-browsers` — downloads the Chromium build Cairn drives using **Cairn's own** Playwright,
  so the revision always matches what Cairn launches (regardless of any other Playwright in the project).
- `cairn doctor` — diagnoses the browser setup (Playwright version, expected Chromium, how to fix).
- `--channel <chrome|msedge>` on `explore`, `design`, `automate`, and `observe` (maps to
  `BROWSER_CHANNEL`) — drive a system browser with no bundled-Chromium download.

### Changed

- **Langfuse / OpenTelemetry are now optional.** `@langfuse/*` and `@opentelemetry/*` moved out of the
  default dependencies (to optional peers); telemetry lazy-loads them only when Langfuse is configured
  and silently no-ops when they're absent. This removes the only `npm audit` moderate
  (`@opentelemetry/core <2.8.0`) from a default install and roughly **two-thirds** of the footprint
  (clean-dir prod packages: **265 → 87**). To enable tracing, install the packages listed in the README.

> **Backward compatibility:** the default `lib` browser backend, the public API, and existing configs
> are unchanged. Tracing and the experimental `cli` backend are opt-in — install their (now optional)
> packages to use them.

[0.3.3]: https://github.com/plune-ai/cairn/compare/v0.3.2...v0.3.3

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-14

### Added

- Per-role model routing (`worker`/`reasoner`) with `LLM_ROUTING` presets `volume` (OpenRouter) and `fast` (Groq), plus `CAIRN_ROLE_*` overrides; per-run, per-role cost & token reporting in `report.md` / `report.json` / the CLI. (#6, #7)
- Groq provider. (#7)
- Reproducible cost benchmark via `npm run bench`. (#8)
- First-class session management — `cairn session capture | ls | rm` (and the `cairn login` alias) — with missing/expired-session UX. (#27)

### Changed

- License: relicensed from GPL-3.0-only to Apache-2.0 (permissive; patent grant). See ADR-0012.
- `cairn explore` hardening: graceful browser/observe error handling, repair-loop no-progress convergence, `CallBudget` usage surfaced in the output, and a clearer first-run summary. (#26)
- Pilot verdict now runs on the strong `reasoner` role (was the cheap `judge` tier). (#6)
- The decoupled `design → automate` flow now runs the same validate⇄repair⇄keep-best loop as `explore`, and `explore` now also emits ATC/MTC case files to `testcases/`. (#39, #40)

> **Backward compatibility:** `LLM_PROFILE` and existing configs are unchanged — per-role routing, cost reporting, and the new session commands are additive and opt-in.
