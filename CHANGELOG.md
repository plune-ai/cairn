## [0.3.3] - 2026-06-18

### Fixed

- **Works inside projects that already have Playwright.** Cairn no longer pulls a second, *alpha*
  `playwright-core`: the experimental `cli` backend's `@playwright/cli` is now an optional peer, so a
  default install resolves a **single stable `playwright-core`** — the same build Cairn launches at
  runtime and the same one its installer targets. Previously the alpha needed a Chromium revision a
  normal `playwright install` never provided, so Cairn reported *"Playwright browsers are not
  installed"* even after following the suggested command.
- **The browser preflight no longer blocks the channel / reuse paths.** `explore` and
  `automate --validate` now pass the configured browser channel to the preflight, so `--channel chrome`
  / `BROWSER_CHANNEL=chrome` drives your installed Google Chrome with **zero download**, and an
  already-installed compatible Chromium is reused instead of demanding a re-install. The generated
  `@playwright/test` config carries the channel end-to-end.
- **Accurate browser diagnostics.** The "browsers not installed" message now prints Cairn's own
  Playwright version, the exact Chromium it expects, and the two real fixes — never the generic
  `npx playwright install` hint, which resolved to the *wrong* Playwright and so never helped.

### Added

- `cairn install-browsers` — downloads the Chromium build Cairn drives using **Cairn's own** Playwright,
  so the revision always matches what Cairn launches (regardless of any other Playwright in the project).
- `cairn doctor` — diagnoses the browser setup (Playwright version, expected Chromium, how to fix).
- `--channel <chrome|msedge>` on `explore`, `design`, `automate`, and `observe` (maps to
  `BROWSER_CHANNEL`) — drive a system browser with no bundled-Chromium download.

### Changed

- **Langfuse / OpenTelemetry are now optional.** `@langfuse/*` and `@opentelemetry/*` moved out of the
  default dependencies (to optional peers); telemetry lazy-loads them only when Langfuse is configured
  and silently no-ops when they're absent. This removes the only `npm audit` moderate
  (`@opentelemetry/core <2.8.0`) from a default install and roughly **two-thirds** of the footprint
  (clean-dir prod packages: **265 → 87**). To enable tracing, install the packages listed in the README.

> **Backward compatibility:** the default `lib` browser backend, the public API, and existing configs
> are unchanged. Tracing and the experimental `cli` backend are opt-in — install their (now optional)
> packages to use them.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-14

### Added

- Per-role model routing (`worker`/`reasoner`) with `LLM_ROUTING` presets `volume` (OpenRouter) and `fast` (Groq), plus `CAIRN_ROLE_*` overrides; per-run, per-role cost & token reporting in `report.md` / `report.json` / the CLI. (#6, #7)
- Groq provider. (#7)
- Reproducible cost benchmark via `npm run bench`. (#8)
- First-class session management — `cairn session capture | ls | rm` (and the `cairn login` alias) — with missing/expired-session UX. (#27)

### Changed

- License: relicensed from GPL-3.0-only to Apache-2.0 (permissive; patent grant). See ADR-0012.
- `cairn explore` hardening: graceful browser/observe error handling, repair-loop no-progress convergence, `CallBudget` usage surfaced in the output, and a clearer first-run summary. (#26)
- Pilot verdict now runs on the strong `reasoner` role (was the cheap `judge` tier). (#6)
- The decoupled `design → automate` flow now runs the same validate⇄repair⇄keep-best loop as `explore`, and `explore` now also emits ATC/MTC case files to `testcases/`. (#39, #40)

> **Backward compatibility:** `LLM_PROFILE` and existing configs are unchanged — per-role routing, cost reporting, and the new session commands are additive and opt-in.
